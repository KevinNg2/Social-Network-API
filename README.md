## Social Networking API

## Description
An API for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list. This application demo uses `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, the `Mongoose` ODM, and `Moment.js` to format timestamps. The seed data is created using `Insomnia`.
